Twinkle twinkle
Little me
I have a lovely light

I'm the star upon your tree
That makes your Christmas bright (mhmm)
Twinkle twinkle, little me
I left the milky way
Just so I could come and be with you on Christmas day
Angels brought me where you are

And heaven gave me light
I'm that friendly little star
You wish upon each night
Twinkle twinkle, little me

I have a present too
And if you give unshelfishly
And make a wish come true
I'll always shine for you
(Talking)
Hi kids, look out your window!

You see that little star way up there?
The one that's all alone?
Well, that's me. That's right.
And this Christmas, I'm coming all the way down to where you are just to light up your Christmas tree.
And I hope to light up your hearts
Well, Twinkle twinkle, little me

I have a present too
If you give unshelfishly
And make a wish come true
I'll always shine for you
